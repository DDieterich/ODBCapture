There are many software tools available to "dump" PL/SQL, SQL, and Data from a database into text files.  ODBCapture does the same, but with a unique capability.  ODBCapture can be configured to capture installation scripts that successfully add new functional layers to a database.  An example of these functional layers is:
1. Mock Layer - Contains mocked database objects and APIs representative of a remote database.
2. Base Layer - Basic database functionality with basic configuration data.
3. Environment Layer - Environment specific configuration data for folders, users, etc...
4. Test Utility Layer - Standard testing utility/application like utPLSQL.
5. Unit Test Layer - Specific unit testing functionality kept separate from base database functionality.
6. Test Data Layer - Set of test data for unit testing, integration, performance testing, etc...
7. ODBCapture Layer - ODBCapture application installation to re-capture database scripts with recent changes.

ODBCapture includes the unique capability to create complete database build scripts with all the required database objects and data.  The build scripts generated by ODBCapture can be used to create a working, functioning database.  Layering of these different build scripts allow different databases to be built from the same database source code for different purposes like development, testing, and quality assurance.  ODBCapture can also create build scripts that support different environments.
